    <strong>Abbey Road</strong>
    is the 11th studio album released by the English rock 
    band the Beatles. It is the last album the group started recording,
    although Let It Be was the last album completed before the band's 
    break-up in April 1970. It was mostly recorded in April, July and 
    August 1969, and was released on 26 September 1969 in the United 
    Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States, reaching number 
    one in both countries. A double A-side single from the album, 
    "Something" / "Come Together" was released in October, which also 
    topped the charts in the US.

    <strong>Please Please Me</strong>
    is the debut studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. 
    Produced by George Martin, it was released on EMI's Parlophone 
    label on 22 March 1963 in the United Kingdom, following the 
    success of the band's first two singles "Love Me Do", which 
    reached number 17 on the Record Retailer Chart,and 
    "Please Please Me", which reached number one on the NME and 
    Melody Maker charts. The album topped Record Retailer's LP chart 
    for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement for a pop album at that 
    time.

    <strong>Beatles For Sale</strong>
    is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. 
    It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI's 
    Parlophone label. The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone 
    that had characterised the Beatles' previous work, partly due to the
     band's exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them 
     as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. Beatles for Sale was not widely 
     available in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was 
     standardised for release on CD. Instead, eight of the album's 
     fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records' concurrent release, 
     Beatles '65, issued in North America only.

    <strong>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</strong>
    is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. 
    Released on 26 May 1967,Sgt. Pepper is regarded by 
    musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the roles of 
    sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record 
    sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an 
    immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with 
    numerous touchstones of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, 
    drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment.

    <strong>Let It Be</strong>
    is the 12th and final studio album by the English rock band the 
    Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, almost a month after the 
    group's break-up, in tandem with the documentary of the same name. 
    Concerned about recent friction within the band, Paul McCartney had 
    conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the group by 
    returning to simpler rock 'n' roll configurations.[2] The album 
    topped charts in many countries, including both the UK and the US, 
    but the critical response was generally unfavourable, and Let It Be 
    came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums in 
    history.
