    <p>Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia (née Stanley) (1914–1958) and Alfred Lennon (1912–1976). Alfred was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.</p>
    <p> His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John "Jack" Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill.His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9 Newcastle Road.</p>
    <p>Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944.When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea.</p>
    <p>After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon.</p>
